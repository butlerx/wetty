# File Downloading

WeTTY supports file downloads by printing terminal escape sequences between a
base64 encoded file.

The terminal escape sequences used are `^[[5i` and `^[[4i` (VT100 for "enter
auto print" and "exit auto print" respectively -
https://vt100.net/docs/tp83/appendixc.html).

To take advantage add the following bash function to your `.bashrc`

```bash
funtion wetty-download() {
  file=${1:-/dev/stdin}

  if [[ -f $file || $file == "/dev/stdin" ]]; then
    printf "\033[5i"$(cat $file | base64 -w 0)"\033[4i"
  else
    echo "$file does not appear to be a file"
  fi
}
```

You are then able to download files via WeTTY!

```bash
wetty-download my-pdf-file.pdf
```

or you can still use the classic style: 

```bash
$ cat my-pdf-file.pdf | wetty-download
```

WeTTY will then issue a popup like the following that links to a local file
blob: `Download ready: file-20191015233654.pdf`
