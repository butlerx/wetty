# Flags

WeTTy can be run with the `--help` flag to get a full list of flags.

## Server Port

WeTTy runs on port `3000` by default. You can change the default port by
starting with the `--port` or `-p` flag.

## SSH Host

If WeTTy is run as root while the host is set as the local machine it will use
the `login` binary rather than ssh. If no host is specified it will use
`localhost` as the ssh host.

If instead you wish to connect to a remote host you can specify the host with
the `--sshhost` flag and pass the IP or DNS address of the host you want to
connect to.

## Default User

You can specify the default user used to ssh to a host using the `--sshuser`.
This user can overwritten by going to
`http://yourserver:3000/wetty/ssh/<username>`. If this is left blank a user will
be prompted to enter their username when they connect.

## SSH Port

By default WeTTy will try to ssh to port `22`, if your host uses an alternative
ssh port this can be specified with the flag `--sshport`.

## WeTTy URL

If you'd prefer an HTTP base prefix other than `/wetty`, you can specify that
with `--base`.

**Do not set this to `/ssh/${something}`, as this will break username matching
code.**
